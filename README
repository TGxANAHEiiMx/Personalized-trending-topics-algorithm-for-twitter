Hey there!

This algorithm was built in 54 hours at StartupWeekend Lexington by @ThomasTommyTom (http://www.tommycrush.com). Here's the most basic explanation: Twitter has trends for a country, state, or cities. But this algorithm finds what's trending in your OWN circle of friends.

Examples:
1) the word "tonight" trends a lot on weekends, as people are talking about their nightlife plans.
2) the phrase "startup weekend" was trending in my circle of friends because a lot of the people that I follow are programmers as well.
3) the name @benrector was trending recently because several of my friends were tweeting at him in the same timespan.


It is not necessarily meant to be easily ported into other applications, but rather as a reference of how to hack something like this together.


The code is not the cleanest in the world, keep in mind this was built in a weekend.
